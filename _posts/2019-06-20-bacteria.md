In addition to mercury and plastic, your seafood might now also contain potentially deadly flesh eating bacteria, thanks to climate change and warmer temperatures. Five people in New Jersey have been treated for Vibrio Vulnificus, a flesh eating bacteria that can be found in shellfish such as crab or oysters. After infection the bacteria consumes your skin which requires treatments like skin grafts or amputation. Since it occurs more frequently in warmer waters, cases of Vibrio Vulnificus in New Jersey from seafood in the cooler Delaware Bay have historically been rare. However, as temperatures gradually increase, flesh eating Vibrio Vulnificus is just one of the fun diseases we can look forward to encountering more often in the imminent and fast approaching centuries of hell.
