The Union of Concerned Scientists released a [new report](https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/global-warming-impacts/killer-heat-in-united-states) and interactive map describing how killer heat will affect counties in the US. The above image shows the predicted average days per year with a heat index above 105Â°F between 2070-2099 if we take no action on climate change (darkest red is 101-203 days per year). It looks like Republicans chose the right color, because ironically Republican leaning states closely corelate to the states that will suffer the most from killer heat.

Unfortunately, by the time people realize their mistake we will be too deep in centuries of hell to do much about it. Check out [the report](https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/global-warming-impacts/killer-heat-in-united-states) or [try out the map](https://ucsusa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=e4e9082a1ec343c794d27f3e12dd006d) to visualize your doom or find Northern state to relocate to where you'll be able to go outside in the summer.
