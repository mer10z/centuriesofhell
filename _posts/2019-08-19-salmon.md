Enjoy wild Alaskan salmon while you can. This summer an Alaskan heatwave has killed thousands of sockeye, chum and pink salmon. The unprecedented die-off was unlike anything scientist have ever seen before. Warmer water temperatures result in reduced oxygen levels in streams, causing pregnant salmon to suffocate on their way to spawn.
