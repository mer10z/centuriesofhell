Historians may very well remember 2020 as the official first year of centuries of hell on earth. Record breaking heat, fires, climate disasters, and a global pandemic really kicked things off with a good preview of the miserable conditions we'll face in the years to come. Now 2021 is following up with a scorcher of a summer, with three massive [record breaking](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/06/27/heat-records-pacific-northwest/) heatwaves in the west coast of North America and torrential rains on the east coast and Europe. While [New York City was underwater](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/08/nyregion/flooding-subways-nyc.html), Portland Oregon broke it's previous record of 107 in 1981 with a temperature of 116 degrees. Seattle hit 108 and Vancouver got 115, both also record breaking highs. So much for moving to the Pacific Northwest to beat the heat. 

And with summer and heat we can't forget the fires. From January 1 through July 4 this year, California had 3,856 fires. That's almost 600 more fires during the first half of the year than last year, and there are already [predictions](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/06/why-2021-could-be-californias-worst-fire-season-ever.html) that the record heat and continued drought will make 2021 even worse than last year. Hopefully we'll survive 2021 but this is only the beginning. From here it will only get worse, so prepare yourself and your family for the next few centuries of hell.
