Employees at Facebook and Google headquarters will eventually need to work in scuba gear according to a [new study](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/05/14/1817205116) that finds sea levels may rise two meters in the next 81 years if global emissions are not reduced. Planes landing at San Francisco and Oakland International Airports will need to be fitted with pontoons since all the runways will be underwater. Check out [this nifty map](https://explorer.adaptingtorisingtides.org/explorer) to see what else will be affected (for us dumb Americans, 2 meters is about 78.7402 inches).
