There were over [130 Tornadoes the past 5 days](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/21/us/severe-weather-tuesday-wxc/index.html) in the central US, mostly in Trump voting states Kansas and Missouri. Perhaps next election they'll support someone who doesn't deny climate change, but don't count on it. How many more disasters will it take before the masses realize centuries of hell are already upon us?
