If you've been struggling with allergies this year, you can look forward to even longer and more intense allergy seasons thanks to climate change. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), less freezing days in the winter and warmer temperatures allow trees to pollinate earlier and longer, and across greater areas that have previously been unexposed to allergens. Increased carbon dioxide helps plants grow faster, so that could also contribute to extreme and extended pollen Tsunamis. Don't worry though, all you need to do is lock yourself inside with HEPA filters or wear a mask when you go outside. Just don't breathe natural air and you'll be fine.
