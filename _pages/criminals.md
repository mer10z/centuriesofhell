<p>The following is a list of people and organizations that are destroying human civilization by preventing action and propagating fake news. Boycott their products, vote them out of office, and find them guilty of crimes against humanity. Who else deserves to be on this list? Give your nomination and the crimes they've committed in the comments.</p>

<h3>Rupert Murdoch</h3>
Has possibly done more to spread public confusion and political gridlock about global warming than anyone else alive, thanks to his fake news organizations like News Corp and FoxNews and Sky TV.

<h3>Charles and David Koch</h3>
Long time opposers of climate change legislation. In 2011 Koch Industries and its subsidiaries emitted over twenty-four million tons of carbon dioxide from 50 sites. Funded efforts to stop the growth of solar power.

<h3>Rex Tillerson & ExxonMobile</h3>
ExxonMobile's oil puts 1 trillion pounds of CO2 into the atmosphere each year and spends millions on lobbying against climate change legislation.

<h3>Mitch McConnell</h3>
Stated that there was "no conclusive evidence of significant long-term global warming". Encouraged state governors not to comply with the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan. Told Trump to withdraw from Paris Accords.

<h3>Jim Inhofe</h3>
U.S. Senator, former chair of the Senate Environment Committee. Called climate change "the greatest hoax ever perpetrated against the American people. Told Trump to withdraw from Paris Accords.

<h3>John Barrasso</h3>
U.S. Senator, chair of the Senate Environment Committee: "The climate is constantly changing. The role human activity plays is not known." Told Trump to withdraw from Paris Accords.

<h3>David Bernhardt</h3>
Interior Secretary of the United Sates - When asked his level of concern about CO2 exceeding 415 parts per million - "I haven't lost any sleep over it"

<h3>Donald Trump</h3>
Called climate change a “hoax” invented by the Chinese. Withdrew from the Paris Accords. Lover of "clean coal". Rolled back a number of environmental protections and appointed a number of climate criminals to his cabinet. Unfortunately he'll probably die before sea level rise submerges Mar-a-Lago.

<h3>Christopher Monckton</h3>
President of the Clexit Coalition. Advocates climate change denial. Stated that those who warn of the dangers of climate change should be jailed.
